Context: In consequence, patients with chronic hypernatremia are less likely to develop severe neurologic compromise. However, the cellular response to chronic hypernatremia predisposes these patients to the development of cerebral edema and seizures during overly rapid hydration (overcorrection of plasma Na+ concentration by >10 mM/d). Diagnostic Approach The history should focus on the presence or absence of thirst, polyuria, and/or an extrarenal source for water loss, 304 such as diarrhea. The physical examination should include a detailed neurologic exam and an assessment of the ECFV; patients with a particularly large water deficit and/or a combined deficit in electrolytes and water may be hypovolemic, with reduced JVP and orthostasis. Accurate documentation of daily fluid intake and daily urine output is also critical for the diagnosis and management of hypernatremia.
Question: An 8-year old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has been lethargic and has had several episodes of nausea and vomiting for the past day. He has also had increased thirst over the past two months. He has lost 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) during this time. He is otherwise healthy and has no history of serious illness. His temperature is 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), blood pressure is 95/68 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 30/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. His mucous membranes are dry. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 16.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 9,500/mm3
Platelet count 380,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 130 mEq/L
K+ 5.5 mEq/L
Cl- 99 mEq/L
HCO3- 16 mEq/L
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Glucose 570 mg/dL
Ketones positive
Blood gases, arterial
pH 7.25
pCO2 21 mm Hg
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"A. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin
B. Intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose solution and 0.45% normal saline
C. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and potassium chloride
D. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate
"
Answer: A. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin

Context: Therefore, the plasma Na+ concentration should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with these agents. In addition, long-term use of tolvaptan has been associated with abnormalities in liver function tests; hence, use of this agent should be restricted to only 1–2 months. A 76-year-old woman presented with a several-month history of diarrhea, with marked worsening over the 2–3 weeks before admission (up to 12 stools a day). Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin.
Question: A 49-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for the first time in twelve years. His chief complaint is a new onset of diarrhea, which nothing seems to improve. He first noticed this diarrhea about a month ago. He complains of greasy stools, which leave a residue in his toilet bowl. Review of systems is notable for alcohol consumption of 12-16 cans of beer per day for the last two decades. Additionally, the patient endorses losing 12 lbs unintentionally over the last month. Vital signs are within normal limits and stable. Exam demonstrates a male who appears older than stated age; abdominal exam is notable for epigastric tenderness to palpation. What is the next step in diagnosis?A. d-Xylose absorption test
B. CT abdomen with IV contrast
C. EGD with biopsy of gastric mucosa
D. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
Answer: B. CT abdomen with IV contrast

Context: Swelling and tenderness are often present over the radial styloid process. The Finkelstein sign is positive, which is elicited by having the patient place the thumb in the palm and close the fingers over it. The wrist is then ulnarly deviated, resulting in pain over the involved tendon sheath in the area of the radial styloid. Treatment consists initially of splinting the wrist and an NSAID. When severe or refractory to conservative treatment, glucocorticoid injections can be very effective.
Question: A 71-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of right wrist pain for 2 days. On examination, redness and swelling were noted on the dorsal aspect of his right wrist. He had  pain with extreme range of motion of the wrist. His history includes 2 hip replacements, 2 previous episodes of gout in both first metatarsophalangeal joints, and hypertension. Two days later, the swelling had increased in the dorsal aspect of his right wrist and hand. Wrist flexion was limited to 80% with severe pain. The pain was present on palpation of the scaphoid bone. Due to the suspicion of fracture, the patient was referred to his general practitioner for radiographs. These findings were consistent with gouty arthritis. What is the most likely cytokine involved in this process?A. IL-1
B. IL-10
C. INFγ
D. IL-5
Answer: A. IL-1

Context: In these circumstances, there is little extra infor-mation to be gained by performing a barium enema.

Question: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?A. CT scan of the abdomen
B. Transabdominal ultrasonography
C. Anorectal manometry
D. Rectal suction biopsy

, Req_loglikelihood('Context: In consequence, patients with chronic hypernatremia are less likely to develop severe neurologic compromise. However, the cellular response to chronic hypernatremia predisposes these patients to the development of cerebral edema and seizures during overly rapid hydration (overcorrection of plasma Na+ concentration by >10 mM/d). Diagnostic Approach The history should focus on the presence or absence of thirst, polyuria, and/or an extrarenal source for water loss, 304 such as diarrhea. The physical examination should include a detailed neurologic exam and an assessment of the ECFV; patients with a particularly large water deficit and/or a combined deficit in electrolytes and water may be hypovolemic, with reduced JVP and orthostasis. Accurate documentation of daily fluid intake and daily urine output is also critical for the diagnosis and management of hypernatremia.\nQuestion: An 8-year old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has been lethargic and has had several episodes of nausea and vomiting for the past day. He has also had increased thirst over the past two months. He has lost 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) during this time. He is otherwise healthy and has no history of serious illness. His temperature is 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), blood pressure is 95/68 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 30/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. His mucous membranes are dry. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 16.2 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,500/mm3\nPlatelet count 380,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 130 mEq/L\nK+ 5.5 mEq/L\nCl- 99 mEq/L\nHCO3- 16 mEq/L\nCreatinine 1.2 mg/dL\nGlucose 570 mg/dL\nKetones positive\nBlood gases, arterial\npH 7.25\npCO2 21 mm Hg\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"A. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin\nB. Intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose solution and 0.45% normal saline\nC. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and potassium chloride\nD. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate\n"\nAnswer: A. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin\n\nContext: Therefore, the plasma Na+ concentration should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with these agents. In addition, long-term use of tolvaptan has been associated with abnormalities in liver function tests; hence, use of this agent should be restricted to only 1–2 months. A 76-year-old woman presented with a several-month history of diarrhea, with marked worsening over the 2–3 weeks before admission (up to 12 stools a day). Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin.\nQuestion: A 49-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for the first time in twelve years. His chief complaint is a new onset of diarrhea, which nothing seems to improve. He first noticed this diarrhea about a month ago. He complains of greasy stools, which leave a residue in his toilet bowl. Review of systems is notable for alcohol consumption of 12-16 cans of beer per day for the last two decades. Additionally, the patient endorses losing 12 lbs unintentionally over the last month. Vital signs are within normal limits and stable. Exam demonstrates a male who appears older than stated age; abdominal exam is notable for epigastric tenderness to palpation. What is the next step in diagnosis?A. d-Xylose absorption test\nB. CT abdomen with IV contrast\nC. EGD with biopsy of gastric mucosa\nD. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy\nAnswer: B. CT abdomen with IV contrast\n\nContext: Swelling and tenderness are often present over the radial styloid process. The Finkelstein sign is positive, which is elicited by having the patient place the thumb in the palm and close the fingers over it. The wrist is then ulnarly deviated, resulting in pain over the involved tendon sheath in the area of the radial styloid. Treatment consists initially of splinting the wrist and an NSAID. When severe or refractory to conservative treatment, glucocorticoid injections can be very effective.\nQuestion: A 71-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of right wrist pain for 2 days. On examination, redness and swelling were noted on the dorsal aspect of his right wrist. He had  pain with extreme range of motion of the wrist. His history includes 2 hip replacements, 2 previous episodes of gout in both first metatarsophalangeal joints, and hypertension. Two days later, the swelling had increased in the dorsal aspect of his right wrist and hand. Wrist flexion was limited to 80% with severe pain. The pain was present on palpation of the scaphoid bone. Due to the suspicion of fracture, the patient was referred to his general practitioner for radiographs. These findings were consistent with gouty arthritis. What is the most likely cytokine involved in this process?A. IL-1\nB. IL-10\nC. INFγ\nD. IL-5\nAnswer: A. IL-1\n\nContext: In these circumstances, there is little extra infor-mation to be gained by performing a barium enema.

Intestinal obstruction in the newborn showing sev-eral loops of distended bowel with air fluid levels. This child has jejunal atresia.Figure 39-15. Operative photograph of newborn with “Christmas tree” type of ileal atresia.when there is diagnostic uncertainty, or when distal intestinal obstruction is apparent, a barium enema is useful to establish whether a microcolon is present and to diagnose the presence of meconium plugs, small left colon syndrome, Hirschsprung’s disease, or meconium ileus.\nQuestion: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient\'s rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?A. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. Transabdominal ultrasonography\nC. Anorectal manometry\nD. Rectal suction biopsy\nAnswer:', ' D. Rectal suction biopsy')[0]
