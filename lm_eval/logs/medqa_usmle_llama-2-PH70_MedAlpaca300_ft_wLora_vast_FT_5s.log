Question: An 8-year old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has been lethargic and has had several episodes of nausea and vomiting for the past day. He has also had increased thirst over the past two months. He has lost 5.4 kg (11.9 lbs) during this time. He is otherwise healthy and has no history of serious illness. His temperature is 37.5 °C (99.5 °F), blood pressure is 95/68 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 30/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. His mucous membranes are dry. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 16.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 9,500/mm3
Platelet count 380,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 130 mEq/L
K+ 5.5 mEq/L
Cl- 99 mEq/L
HCO3- 16 mEq/L
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Glucose 570 mg/dL
Ketones positive
Blood gases, arterial
pH 7.25
pCO2 21 mm Hg
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"
(A) Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin (B) Intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose solution and 0.45% normal saline (C) Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and potassium chloride (D) Intravenous sodium bicarbonate
"
Answer: Intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin

Question: A 49-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for the first time in twelve years. His chief complaint is a new onset of diarrhea, which nothing seems to improve. He first noticed this diarrhea about a month ago. He complains of greasy stools, which leave a residue in his toilet bowl. Review of systems is notable for alcohol consumption of 12-16 cans of beer per day for the last two decades. Additionally, the patient endorses losing 12 lbs unintentionally over the last month. Vital signs are within normal limits and stable. Exam demonstrates a male who appears older than stated age; abdominal exam is notable for epigastric tenderness to palpation. What is the next step in diagnosis?
(A) d-Xylose absorption test (B) CT abdomen with IV contrast (C) EGD with biopsy of gastric mucosa (D) Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
Answer: CT abdomen with IV contrast

Question: A 71-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of right wrist pain for 2 days. On examination, redness and swelling were noted on the dorsal aspect of his right wrist. He had  pain with extreme range of motion of the wrist. His history includes 2 hip replacements, 2 previous episodes of gout in both first metatarsophalangeal joints, and hypertension. Two days later, the swelling had increased in the dorsal aspect of his right wrist and hand. Wrist flexion was limited to 80% with severe pain. The pain was present on palpation of the scaphoid bone. Due to the suspicion of fracture, the patient was referred to his general practitioner for radiographs. These findings were consistent with gouty arthritis. What is the most likely cytokine involved in this process?
(A) IL-1 (B) IL-10 (C) INFγ (D) IL-5
Answer: IL-1

Question: A 34-year-old man is brought to a psychiatric hospital by friends for erratic behavior. He has been up for the past several nights painting his apartment walls purple and reading the Bible out loud, as well as talking fast and making sexually provocative comments. Collateral information from family reveals 2 similar episodes last year. Mental status exam is notable for labile affect and grandiose delusions. Urine toxicology is negative. The patient is admitted and started on lithium for mania. His symptoms resolve within 2 weeks. How should this patient’s lithium be managed in anticipation of discharge?
(A) Continue lithium lifelong (B) Continue lithium until a therapeutic serum lithium level is reached, then taper it (C) Cross-taper lithium to aripiprazole for maintenance therapy (D) Discontinue lithium, but re-start in the future if the patient has another manic episode
Answer: Continue lithium lifelong

Question: A scientist is working on creating synthetic hemoglobin that can be used to replace blood loss in humans. She therefore starts to study the behavior of this artificial hemoglobin in terms of its ability to bind oxygen. She begins by measuring the affinity between this synthetic hemoglobin and oxygen in a purified system before introducing modifications to this system. Specifically, she reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the system to mimic conditions within the lungs and plots an affinity curve. Which of the following should be observed in this artificial hemoglobin if it mimics the behavior of normal hemoglobin?
(A) Left-shifted curve and decreased oxygen binding (B) Left-shifted curve and increased oxygen binding (C) No shift in the curve and increased oxygen binding (D) Right-shifted curve and decreased oxygen binding
Answer: Left-shifted curve and increased oxygen binding

Question: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
(A) CT scan of the abdomen (B) Transabdominal ultrasonography (C) Anorectal manometry (D) Rectal suction biopsy

Which of the following should be observed in this artificial hemoglobin if it mimics the behavior of normal hemoglobin?\n(A) Left-shifted curve and decreased oxygen binding (B) Left-shifted curve and increased oxygen binding (C) No shift in the curve and increased oxygen binding (D) Right-shifted curve and decreased oxygen binding\nAnswer: Left-shifted curve and increased oxygen binding\n\nQuestion: A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient\'s rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n(A) CT scan of the abdomen (B) Transabdominal ultrasonography (C) Anorectal manometry (D) Rectal suction biopsy\nAnswer:', ' Rectal suction biopsy')[0]
