Question: A 72-year-old woman is evaluated in the acute rehabilitation facility where she has been receiving physical therapy  since sustaining a stroke 2 weeks ago that resulted in moderate left hemiparesis. A swallowing study obtained on  admission to the facility showed no abnormalities and she has been progressing well with her rehabilitation. She is  able to walk with the aid of a walker and assistant, has no speech impairment, and tolerates a regular diet. Medical  history also is notable for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications are lisinopril, simvastatin,  and daily aspirin. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min and regular, respirations are 12/min, and blood  pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle  strength in the extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Standardized  assessment of cognitive function shows no abnormalities. For the past 2 days, the patient has insisted that she is well  enough to go home despite not being fully cleared to do so by her physical therapist and physiatrist, who want her to  stay for 1 more week to try to advance from the walker to a cane. The patient lives with her daughter, son-in-law,  and grandson, and has a bedroom on the main floor of the house with no need to use stairs. The daughter works as a  stay-at-home mother.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105).

Question: A 72-year-old woman is evaluated in the acute rehabilitation facility where she has been receiving physical therapy  since sustaining a stroke 2 weeks ago that resulted in moderate left hemiparesis. A swallowing study obtained on  admission to the facility showed no abnormalities and she has been progressing well with her rehabilitation. She is  able to walk with the aid of a walker and assistant, has no speech impairment, and tolerates a regular diet. Medical  history also is notable for well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications are lisinopril, simvastatin,  and daily aspirin.

Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle  strength in the extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Standardized  assessment of cognitive function shows no abnormalities. For the past 2 days, the patient has insisted that she is well  enough to go home despite not being fully cleared to do so by her physical therapist and physiatrist, who want her to  stay for 1 more week to try to advance from the walker to a cane.
