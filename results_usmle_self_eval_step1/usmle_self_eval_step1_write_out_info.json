The rash began over her trunk area but spread within a day to her face and extremities. Two days before development of the rash, she had flu-like symptoms with muscle aches and fatigue as well as a nonproductive cough, sore throat, and runny nose. Ten days ago, she began treatment with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection; she takes no other medications. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 165/105 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse brownish red macular exanthema with bullous lesions. Epidermis at an uninvolved site can be removed with mild tangential pressure. Examination of a biopsy specimen of one of the lesions shows necrosis of keratinocytes throughout the epidermis. There is minimal lymphocytic infiltration within the superficial dermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n(A) Erythema multiforme (B) Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (C) Pemphigus vulgaris (D) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (E) Toxic epidermal necrolysis\nAnswer: Toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\nQuestion: A 58-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comes to the clinic with his wife for a follow-up examination. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He has tried to quit smoking twice but was unsuccessful both times. At today’s visit, when the physician asks the patient about smoking cessation, he says he is not ready to do so. The patient’s wife states her husband’s smoking makes her cough and gives her chest tightness. Which of the following is the most appropriate physician statement?\n(A) \"Are there any reasons why you might want to quit smoking?\" (B) \"Are you aware that your lung condition is chronic at this point?\" (C) \"I'm sure you don't want your wife to suffer as a result of your smoking.\" (D) \"The majority of your health issues would improve if you quit smoking.\" (E) \"Why haven't you been able to stay off cigarettes?\"\nAnswer: \"Are there any reasons why you might want to quit smoking?\"\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of cold intolerance, constipation, and severe fatigue. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight gain during this period. Her current medication is daily levothyroxine. She also started taking calcium carbonate supplements 2 months ago for osteopenia of the lumbar spine.

During this time, she also has been “gaining weight around the middle” despite increased exercise; she has had a 6.3-kg (14-lb) weight gain.  She has no other history of major medical illness. Her only medication is lisinopril. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 107 kg (236 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m². Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Pelvic ultrasonography shows oligohydramnios and a fetus with a misshapen cranium, pericardial effusion, small bladder, and echogenic bowel. The most likely cause of the fetal abnormalities in this patient’s pregnancy is interference with which of the following?\n(A) Fetal lung/epithelial differentiation (B) Fetal lung/surfactant development (C) Fetal renal hemodynamics (D) Maternal placental perfusion (E) Maternal prostaglandin synthesis\nAnswer: Fetal renal hemodynamics\n\nQuestion: A 30-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 4-day history of an increasingly severe, painful rash over her body and in her mouth. The rash began over her trunk area but spread within a day to her face and extremities. Two days before development of the rash, she had flu-like symptoms with muscle aches and fatigue as well as a nonproductive cough, sore throat, and runny nose. Ten days ago, she began treatment with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection; she takes no other medications. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 165/105 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse brownish red macular exanthema with bullous lesions. Epidermis at an uninvolved site can be removed with mild tangential pressure. Examination of a biopsy specimen of one of the lesions shows necrosis of keratinocytes throughout the epidermis. There is minimal lymphocytic infiltration within the superficial dermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n(A) Erythema multiforme (B) Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (C) Pemphigus vulgaris (D) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (E) Toxic epidermal necrolysis\nAnswer: Toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\nQuestion: A 72-year-old man comes to the physician for a health maintenance examination. He has no personal or family historyof major medical illnesses. He has never smoked cigarettes. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturationof 98%. Physical examination shows plethoric skin and splenomegaly. Laboratory studies show:Hemoglobin 21.1 g/dLHematocrit 61%Leukocyte count 15,000/mm³Segmented neutrophils 68%Basophils 4%Lymphocytes 28%Platelet count 501,000/mm³Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase increasedA peripheral blood smear shows occasional giant platelets. The primary hematologic defect in this patient most likely occurred in which of the following cells?\n(A) Erythroid progenitor (B) Hematopoietic stem (C) Lymphatic progenitor (D) Megakaryocyte progenitor (E) Pluripotent stem\nAnswer: Hematopoietic stem\n\nQuestion: A 1-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever and cough. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 140/min, and respirations are 54/min. Physical examination shows intercostal retractions. Wheezes are heard in all lung fields. A blood culture grows coagulase-negative, catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci in clusters. Which of the following best represents the infectious agent in this patient's blood culture?\n(A) Staphylococcus aureus, contaminant (B) Staphylococcus aureus, pathogen (C) Staphylococcus epidermidis, contaminant (D) Staphylococcus epidermidis, pathogen (E) Streptococcus pneumoniae, contaminant (F) Streptococcus pneumoniae, pathogen (G) Streptococcus sanguis, contaminant (H) Streptococcus sanguis, pathogen\nAnswer: Staphylococcus epidermidis, contaminant\n\nQuestion: A 4-year-old boy develops fever 3 weeks after being admitted to the hospital for induction chemotherapy for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chemotherapy medications are L-asparaginase, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and vincristine. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical examination shows pallor, alopecia, and ulcerations over the gums. A central venous catheter with entry site in the right upper chest is present but has no surrounding erythema. A blood culture grows gram-negative rods after 36 hours. Which of the following underlying mechanisms is the most likely cause of this patient's susceptibility to infection?\n(A) Deficiency of terminal complement (B) Hypogammaglobulinemia (C) Impaired T-lymphocyte function (D) Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α function (E) Neutropenia\nAnswer: Neutropenia\n\nQuestion: A 6-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is brought to the office for a follow-up examination. He is receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy. A drug is added to the patient's medication regimen to decrease the toxicity of this therapy to normal cells. The beneficial effect of this new drug on normal cells is most likely achieved by bypassing the cellular requirement for which of the following enzymes?\n(A) Dihydrofolate reductase (B) Methionine synthase (C) Pyruvate decarboxylase (D) Thiamine pyrophosphate (E) Thymidylate synthase\nAnswer: Dihydrofolate reductase",
