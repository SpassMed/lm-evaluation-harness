He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, andaspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequentperipheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. Thepatient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery andplacement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Eachstent costs the hospital $15,000. Alternatives to this approach include amputation of the toe, balloon angioplasty,and use of less expensive stents.

He did not lose consciousness but has multiple rib fractures with depression of the left anterior chest wall. His parents have been notified and are on their way to the hospital. On the patient's arrival to the ED, his temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 65/30 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended with exquisite tenderness to palpation. A rapid intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. CT scans are quickly obtained and show a disrupted spleen and an abdominal cavity filled with free fluid. The parents arrive at the hospital and are informed that their son needs an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy to control the internal bleeding. A saline infusion is continued to support the patient's blood pressure. The parents provide consent to proceed with the operation but refuse to consent to transfusion of blood or blood products, regardless of consequences, because of their religious beliefs. As the patient is transferred to the operating room, his pulse is 210/min and blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. Hemoglobin concentration is 3.8 g/dL. The surgeon agrees with the anesthesiologist that the patient will die without transfusion of blood and plasma. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?\n(A) Contact the national organization of the parents’ religion and insist that the parents speak with a representative on the phone regarding the matter (B) Contact the parents’ religious advisor to request help in acquiring consent for blood transfusion (C) Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order (D) Proceed with the operation and abide by the parents’ wishes that no blood products be used (E) Transfer the patient by ambulance immediately to a bloodless surgical center\nAnswer: Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of moderate chest pain after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure 30 minutes ago.

He says he feels well. His medications are metoprolol and  lisinopril. His older brother, who was \"seemingly in good health,\" recently underwent emergency repair of a  ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that had not been diagnosed previously. The patient retired from the military 15  years ago. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 20 years ago. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in)  tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m². Pulse is 72/min and regular, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg.  Abdominal examination shows no organomegaly or tenderness to palpation. The aortic pulsation is estimated at 3  cm in width. A midepigastric bruit is heard. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the  following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n(A) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (B) Digital angiography of the aorta (C) Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen (D) X-ray of the abdomen (E) No diagnostic imaging is indicated\nAnswer: Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen\n\nQuestion: A 15-year-old girl is brought to the office because she has never had a menstrual period. She has no history ofserious illness and receives no medications. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Breast developmentbegan at the age of 10 years. She has never been sexually active. She is at the 90th percentile for height, 75thpercentile for weight, and 69th percentile for BMI. Sexual maturity rating is 4 for breast development. Pelvicexamination shows a normal-appearing vagina; the cervix and uterus cannot be palpated. Her serum testosteroneconcentration is 340 ng/dL (N=5–40). Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,thyroid-stimulating hormone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and prolactin are within the reference ranges.

She says that despite the test results, she has had anxiety, insomnia, and a preoccupation  with cancer since noticing the lump. Two weeks ago, she had a 20-minute episode of markedly intense anxiety  characterized by heart palpitations and the fear that she was dying. She says she has always been a tense, nervous  person and is uncomfortable in social situations. She says she frequently worries and is fearful of the future and  apprehensive of dying. She has no other history of panic episodes, traumatic events, or serious illness and takes no  medications. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Physical examination shows a 2-cm mass in the left  breast. On mental status examination, she is cooperative but worried. Her thought processes are linear, and content  focuses on possible negative eventualities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n(A) Avoidant personality disorder (B) Generalized anxiety disorder (C) Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis) (D) Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (E) Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)\nAnswer: Generalized anxiety disorder\n\nQuestion: A 30-year-old nulligravid woman, who is a military veteran, comes to the office because she has not had a menstrual period for the past year.

He did not lose consciousness but has multiple rib fractures with depression of the left anterior chest wall. His parents have been notified and are on their way to the hospital. On the patient's arrival to the ED, his temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 65/30 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended with exquisite tenderness to palpation. A rapid intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. CT scans are quickly obtained and show a disrupted spleen and an abdominal cavity filled with free fluid. The parents arrive at the hospital and are informed that their son needs an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy to control the internal bleeding. A saline infusion is continued to support the patient's blood pressure. The parents provide consent to proceed with the operation but refuse to consent to transfusion of blood or blood products, regardless of consequences, because of their religious beliefs. As the patient is transferred to the operating room, his pulse is 210/min and blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. Hemoglobin concentration is 3.8 g/dL. The surgeon agrees with the anesthesiologist that the patient will die without transfusion of blood and plasma. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?\n(A) Contact the national organization of the parents’ religion and insist that the parents speak with a representative on the phone regarding the matter (B) Contact the parents’ religious advisor to request help in acquiring consent for blood transfusion (C) Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order (D) Proceed with the operation and abide by the parents’ wishes that no blood products be used (E) Transfer the patient by ambulance immediately to a bloodless surgical center\nAnswer: Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive fatigue and episodes of  moderate abdominal pain.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.Outcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).Main results15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

She feels well, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She previously used an oral contraceptive but discontinued it 3 months ago. She has no history of sexually transmitted diseases. She is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with a male partner who is the father. She has had five lifetime sexual partners. She has a pet cat. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 10-week gestation. Testing for which of the following infectious conditions is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?\n(A) Bacterial vaginosis (B) Cytomegalovirus (C) Epstein-Barr virus (D) HIV (E) Human papillomavirus\nAnswer: HIV\n\nQuestion: A 50-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of severely painful lesions  over her right leg and temperatures to 38.7°C (101.7°F). She has a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her  only medication is insulin. On arrival, temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F). Examination of the right lower extremity  shows exquisite tenderness to palpation, edema, and warmth. The extremity appears shiny and diffusely  erythematous without sharp margins. The subcutaneous tissue is firm, and there are areas of notable skin breakdown  with bullae containing thick purple fluid. Examination of the left lower extremity shows no abnormalities. Which of  the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n(A) Cellulitis (B) Dermatophytosis (C) Erysipelas (D) Erythema nodosum (E) Herpes zoster (F) Necrotizing fasciitis\nAnswer: Necrotizing fasciitis\n\nQuestion: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance 45 minutes after he was struck by a car while riding his bicycle. He did not lose consciousness but has multiple rib fractures with depression of the left anterior chest wall. His parents have been notified and are on their way to the hospital. On the patient's arrival to the ED, his temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 65/30 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended with exquisite tenderness to palpation. A rapid intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. CT scans are quickly obtained and show a disrupted spleen and an abdominal cavity filled with free fluid. The parents arrive at the hospital and are informed that their son needs an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy to control the internal bleeding. A saline infusion is continued to support the patient's blood pressure. The parents provide consent to proceed with the operation but refuse to consent to transfusion of blood or blood products, regardless of consequences, because of their religious beliefs.

He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, andaspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequentperipheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. Thepatient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery andplacement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Eachstent costs the hospital $15,000. Alternatives to this approach include amputation of the toe, balloon angioplasty,and use of less expensive stents.

        "prompt_3": "Question: An 85-year-old man with severe dementia, Alzheimer type, is admitted to the hospital because of a nonhealing ulceron his right second toe. He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, andaspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequentperipheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. Thepatient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery andplacement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Eachstent costs the hospital $15,000. Alternatives to this approach include amputation of the toe, balloon angioplasty,and use of less expensive stents. Which of the following best describes the public policy implications of thisscenario?\n(A) Absence of resource stewardship (B) Ageism (C) Health care disparities (D) Health care fraud and abuse (E) Lack of access to care\nAnswer: Absence of resource stewardship\n\nQuestion: An investigator would like to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among adult patients with risk factors including obesity, decreased physical activity, and family history of diabetes mellitus.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.Outcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).Main results15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n(A) Test of the stool for occult blood (B) Complete blood count (C) Measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration (D) Serum lipid studies (E) No further evaluation is necessary\nAnswer: Serum lipid studies\n\nQuestion: An 85-year-old man with severe dementia, Alzheimer type, is admitted to the hospital because of a nonhealing ulceron his right second toe. He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, andaspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequentperipheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. Thepatient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery andplacement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Eachstent costs the hospital $15,000. Alternatives to this approach include amputation of the toe, balloon angioplasty,and use of less expensive stents.

He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, andaspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequentperipheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. Thepatient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery andplacement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Eachstent costs the hospital $15,000. Alternatives to this approach include amputation of the toe, balloon angioplasty,and use of less expensive stents.

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.Outcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).Main results15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4).

        "prompt_0": "Question: A clinical trial is performed to assess the efficacy of aspirin in decreasing the risk for myocardial infarction. Twenty-two thousand male physicians with no history of coronary artery disease are randomly assigned to receive aspirin  (325 mg/d) or a placebo. After following the subjects for 5 years, results show that the incidence of myocardial  infarction is 1.2% in the aspirin group and 2.2% in the placebo group. The reduction in incidence is statistically  significant. Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of these results?\n(A) Absolute risk reduction is 1% (B) Absolute risk reduction is 10% (C) Number needed to treat is 4 (D) Number needed to treat is 25 (E) Relative risk reduction is 25% (F) Relative risk reduction is 75%\nAnswer: Absolute risk reduction is 1%\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She received the diagnosis of hypertension 3 weeks ago, and lisinopril therapy was begun at that time. She has had a constant, nonproductive, hacking cough for 2 weeks but has not had any other problems. She has no history of serious illness and takes no other medications. She does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily. She does aerobic exercise for 30 minutes four to five times weekly. Her blood pressure has decreased from 164/92 mm Hg 3 weeks ago to 140/84 mm Hg today. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's cough?\n(A) Pulmonary function tests (B) CT scan of the chest (C) Course of prednisone (D) Discontinuation of lisinopril (E) Use of a cough suppressant (F) No change in management is indicated at this time\nAnswer: Discontinuation of lisinopril\n\nQuestion: A 13-month-old boy is brought to a small rural emergency department (ED) near his family's community because of an erythematous, edematous mass in his perianal area that is hot to touch. He has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Vaccinations are up-to-date. He is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. Temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse is 160/min, and respirations are 36/min. Examination shows fluctuance and exquisite tenderness to palpation of the perianal mass. Oral acetaminophen and a dose of oral cephalexin are administered, and the parents are told that their child’s case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. They are referred to the nearest hospital with a pediatric service, a suburban hospital 50 miles away. The suburban hospital is contacted regarding the referral and a pediatric surgeon accepts transfer of the patient. When the patient is brought to the ED of the suburban hospital, a triage nurse obtains his oral temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and pulse of 126/min. The nurse notes that the family has no health insurance and states that the case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. The nurse recommends taking the patient to the ED of a downtown university hospital 4 miles away. The parents follow this recommendation, and the patient undergoes incision and drainage of the abscess at the downtown hospital later that day. Which of the following is the most accurate characterization of this patient's pattern of care?\n(A) The patient received appropriate care under the circumstances (B) The pediatric surgeon at the suburban hospital should have insisted on personally examining the patient and (C) The rural hospital should have sent the patient directly to the downtown university hospital (D) The suburban hospital executed unethical but legal conduct in this case (E) The suburban hospital violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)\nAnswer: The suburban hospital violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit 10 weeks after a home pregnancy test was positive. She feels well, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She previously used an oral contraceptive but discontinued it 3 months ago. She has no history of sexually transmitted diseases. She is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with a male partner who is the father. She has had five lifetime sexual partners. She has a pet cat. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 10-week gestation. Testing for which of the following infectious conditions is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?\n(A) Bacterial vaginosis (B) Cytomegalovirus (C) Epstein-Barr virus (D) HIV (E) Human papillomavirus\nAnswer: HIV\n\nQuestion: A 43-year-old woman comes to the office for a follow-up examination 1 week after she was discharged from the hospital following an overnight admission for an episode of crushing, aching chest pain. The pain was located behind her sternum and radiated to her left jaw and shoulder. She also had shortness of breath, palpitations, and nausea. Initial ECG obtained on admission showed ST-segment depressions in leads V₃ through V₆. Nitroglycerin was administered, and the chest pain resolved. Follow-up serial ECGs disclosed no abnormalities and serum troponin concentrations were within the reference ranges. Cardiac catheterization obtained the next morning showed no substantial narrowing of the coronary arteries. At discharge, the patient declined medication to prevent recurrence of pain. The patient reports that since discharge, she has had two episodes of chest discomfort lasting 2 to 4 minutes, similar in location and quality to the pain precipitating her hospitalization. Medical history otherwise is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prescribe at this time?\n(A) Diltiazem (B) Lisinopril (C) Propranolol (D) Warfarin (E) No pharmacotherapy is indicated at this time\nAnswer: Diltiazem\n\nQuestion: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance 45 minutes after he was struck by a car while riding his bicycle. He did not lose consciousness but has multiple rib fractures with depression of the left anterior chest wall. His parents have been notified and are on their way to the hospital. On the patient's arrival to the ED, his temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 65/30 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended with exquisite tenderness to palpation. A rapid intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. CT scans are quickly obtained and show a disrupted spleen and an abdominal cavity filled with free fluid. The parents arrive at the hospital and are informed that their son needs an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy to control the internal bleeding. A saline infusion is continued to support the patient's blood pressure. The parents provide consent to proceed with the operation but refuse to consent to transfusion of blood or blood products, regardless of consequences, because of their religious beliefs. As the patient is transferred to the operating room, his pulse is 210/min and blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. Hemoglobin concentration is 3.8 g/dL. The surgeon agrees with the anesthesiologist that the patient will die without transfusion of blood and plasma. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?\n(A) Contact the national organization of the parents’ religion and insist that the parents speak with a representative on the phone regarding the matter (B) Contact the parents’ religious advisor to request help in acquiring consent for blood transfusion (C) Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order (D) Proceed with the operation and abide by the parents’ wishes that no blood products be used (E) Transfer the patient by ambulance immediately to a bloodless surgical center\nAnswer: Contact the national organization of the parents’ religion and insist that the parents speak with a representative on the phone regarding the matter",

He has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Vaccinations are up-to-date. He is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. Temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse is 160/min, and respirations are 36/min. Examination shows fluctuance and exquisite tenderness to palpation of the perianal mass. Oral acetaminophen and a dose of oral cephalexin are administered, and the parents are told that their child’s case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. They are referred to the nearest hospital with a pediatric service, a suburban hospital 50 miles away. The suburban hospital is contacted regarding the referral and a pediatric surgeon accepts transfer of the patient. When the patient is brought to the ED of the suburban hospital, a triage nurse obtains his oral temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and pulse of 126/min. The nurse notes that the family has no health insurance and states that the case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. The nurse recommends taking the patient to the ED of a downtown university hospital 4 miles away. The parents follow this recommendation, and the patient undergoes incision and drainage of the abscess at the downtown hospital later that day. Which of the following is the most accurate characterization of this patient's pattern of care?\n(A) The patient received appropriate care under the circumstances (B) The pediatric surgeon at the suburban hospital should have insisted on personally examining the patient and (C) The rural hospital should have sent the patient directly to the downtown university hospital (D) The suburban hospital executed unethical but legal conduct in this case (E) The suburban hospital violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)\nAnswer: The suburban hospital violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit 10 weeks after a home pregnancy test was positive.

The pain was located behind her sternum and radiated to her left jaw and shoulder. She also had shortness of breath, palpitations, and nausea. Initial ECG obtained on admission showed ST-segment depressions in leads V₃ through V₆. Nitroglycerin was administered, and the chest pain resolved. Follow-up serial ECGs disclosed no abnormalities and serum troponin concentrations were within the reference ranges. Cardiac catheterization obtained the next morning showed no substantial narrowing of the coronary arteries. At discharge, the patient declined medication to prevent recurrence of pain. The patient reports that since discharge, she has had two episodes of chest discomfort lasting 2 to 4 minutes, similar in location and quality to the pain precipitating her hospitalization. Medical history otherwise is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prescribe at this time?\n(A) Diltiazem (B) Lisinopril (C) Propranolol (D) Warfarin (E) No pharmacotherapy is indicated at this time\nAnswer: Diltiazem\n\nQuestion: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance 45 minutes after he was struck by a car while riding his bicycle. He did not lose consciousness but has multiple rib fractures with depression of the left anterior chest wall. His parents have been notified and are on their way to the hospital. On the patient's arrival to the ED, his temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 65/30 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended with exquisite tenderness to palpation. A rapid intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. CT scans are quickly obtained and show a disrupted spleen and an abdominal cavity filled with free fluid. The parents arrive at the hospital and are informed that their son needs an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy to control the internal bleeding. A saline infusion is continued to support the patient's blood pressure. The parents provide consent to proceed with the operation but refuse to consent to transfusion of blood or blood products, regardless of consequences, because of their religious beliefs. As the patient is transferred to the operating room, his pulse is 210/min and blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. Hemoglobin concentration is 3.8 g/dL. The surgeon agrees with the anesthesiologist that the patient will die without transfusion of blood and plasma. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?\n(A) Contact the national organization of the parents’ religion and insist that the parents speak with a representative on the phone regarding the matter (B) Contact the parents’ religious advisor to request help in acquiring consent for blood transfusion (C) Proceed with the blood transfusion while obtaining an emergency telephone court order (D) Proceed with the operation and abide by the parents’ wishes that no blood products be used (E) Transfer the patient by ambulance immediately to a bloodless surgical center\nAnswer: Transfer the patient by ambulance immediately to a bloodless surgical center",
